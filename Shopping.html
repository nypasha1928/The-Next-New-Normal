            <p>
                The COVID-19 pandemic has reset the retail game board. The most successful retailers will be those that connect with consumers in new ways by leaning in on their digital, omnichannel, and in-store technology ambitions. In this edition, The Next Normal explores the coming decade in shopper experience and retail technology.

          <b>2040: Our vision for the future of Shopping </b><br><br>
          By 2040, health care as we know it today will no longer exist. There will be a fundamental shift from “health care” to “health.” And while disease will never be completely eliminated, through science, data, and technology, we will be able to identify it earlier, intervene proactively, and better understand its progression to help consumers more effectively and actively sustain their well-being. The future will be focused on wellness and managed by companies that assume new roles to drive value in the transformed health ecosystem. <br><br>

          Driven by greater data connectivity; interoperable and open, secure platforms; and increasing consumer engagement, archetypes are likely to emerge and will replace and redefine today’s traditional life sciences and health care roles to power the future of health. The 10 archetypes will fall into three distinct, but interconnected, categories:<br><br>

          <b>Data and platforms:</b> These archetypes will be the foundational infrastructure that form the backbone of tomorrow’s health ecosystem. They will generate the insights for decision making. Everything else will build off of the data and platforms that underpin consumer-driven health.<br>
          <b>Well-being and care delivery:</b>These archetypes will be the most health-focused of the three groupings, made up of care facilities and health communities—both virtual and physical, and will provide consumer-centric delivery of products, care, wellness and well-being.<br>
          <b>Care enablement:</b> These archetypes will be connectors, financers, and regulators that help make the industry’s “engine” run.<br><br>
          All three components need to be fully functioning and integrated for the future of health to come to life.<br><br>

          Whether it’s just one or several of these archetypes, life sciences and health care organizations need to make choices now to decide which role(s) they want to play in the future.<br> Critical to this decision is understanding how multiple archetypes could fit together into a cohesive strategy and new business models required for success in the future.<br><br>

                    An Unusual job title . At Salesforce, I study how technology is changing 
                    markets and behaviors. I then reverse engineer trends to help executives 
                    and decision makers understand how to get in front of those trends—through 
                    technology investments or by reimagining business models, operational models, 
                    and leadership mindsets. In other words, I help people see the future of business differently,

                    Tiger of Sweden CEO Linda Dauriz believes that the unexpected can take 
                    many forms. In the fashion industry, that can mean new shapes, new fits, 
                    and new materials with innovative functionalities. And she hopes that, 
                    in the future, consumers will still delight in the unexpected, even as 
                    brands increasingly personalize their goods and services.
