                Everybody likes to get a package. In 2020, we'll send more than 100 billion of them—and that number could double by 2030. Who will deliver all those packages, and how? In this edition, The Next Normal explores what's ahead in last-mile parcel delivery.

          <b>2040: Our vision for the future of Parcel </b><br><br>
          By 2040, health care as we know it today will no longer exist. There will be a fundamental shift from “health care” to “health.” And while disease will never be completely eliminated, through science, data, and technology, we will be able to identify it earlier, intervene proactively, and better understand its progression to help consumers more effectively and actively sustain their well-being. The future will be focused on wellness and managed by companies that assume new roles to drive value in the transformed health ecosystem. <br><br>

          Driven by greater data connectivity; interoperable and open, secure platforms; and increasing consumer engagement, archetypes are likely to emerge and will replace and redefine today’s traditional life sciences and health care roles to power the future of health. The 10 archetypes will fall into three distinct, but interconnected, categories:<br><br>

          <b>Data and platforms:</b> These archetypes will be the foundational infrastructure that form the backbone of tomorrow’s health ecosystem. They will generate the insights for decision making. Everything else will build off of the data and platforms that underpin consumer-driven health.<br>
          <b>Well-being and care delivery:</b>These archetypes will be the most health-focused of the three groupings, made up of care facilities and health communities—both virtual and physical, and will provide consumer-centric delivery of products, care, wellness and well-being.<br>
          <b>Care enablement:</b> These archetypes will be connectors, financers, and regulators that help make the industry’s “engine” run.<br><br>
          All three components need to be fully functioning and integrated for the future of health to come to life.<br><br>

          Whether it’s just one or several of these archetypes, life sciences and health care organizations need to make choices now to decide which role(s) they want to play in the future.<br> Critical to this decision is understanding how multiple archetypes could fit together into a cohesive strategy and new business models required for success in the future.<br><br>

                    Today, SF Express already handles a daily volume of about 20,000 tons in parcel 
                    delivery, and that’s only domestically. Looking at a ten-year time horizon, 
                    I think the overall market will grow by 15 percent per annum at least, 
                    "I believe 12-hour delivery will be a standardized service, pan-China, in five years.", says  Assistant CEO Eddie Huang of SF Express.

                    Wayfair has come a long way from its humble origins in (you guessed it) a college

                    19 million active customers in Europe and North America. In 2019, the company and its 
                    logistics partners expect to ship more than 30 million parcels; many will pass through its 
                    network of 15 warehouses (12 in the United States, 1 in Canada, and 2 in Europe), 7 cross-docking 
                    facilities, and 40 last-mile delivery depots. Connecting these millions of dots is the job of Sascha Hower, 
                    Wayfair’s head of supply chain, Europe.

                    Modern logistics! It would be hard to imagine our daily digital lives without them. 
                    As consumers, we can shop online every day and any hour of the day. We expect everything
                    to arrive on time – whether clothing, printer spare parts or a set of screws. Online shopping 
                    is booming: in 2018, courier, express and parcel services, the so-called CEP sector, delivered around 
                    3.5 billion shipments in Germany alone. And this is an upward trend. But how does all this work so smoothly, 
                    safely and on time? After all, we live in turbulent times: digitalization, climate crisis, growing world population 
                    and political and economic instability. How does the logistics industry rise to such challenges? For answers to these questions 
                    we need to dive deep into the world of modern logistics. Our film takes us into huge, fully connected warehouses, watching as fleets of 
                    cargo planes are prepared for take-off at night and accompanying couriers on delivery bikes on "the last mile" to the customer. We look 
                    at one of the world's largest logistics providers at work: Deutsche Post DHL Group. We are more looking into solutions of robotization, working 
                    together with human workers within the warehouse on one hand. But also artificial intelligence and big data crunching is getting more and more important.

                    Mercedes-Benz Vans is presenting two new solutions for the courier, express and parcel industry. 
                    See how technology safes time in this video.
                    Introducting CoROS:
                    The Cargo Recognition and Organization System, or CoROS, transforms Mercedes-Benz Vans into an intelligent 
                    cargo space via computer vision and artificial intelligence. CoROS automates labor-intensive processes throughout 
                    the last mile and tracks cargo from distribution hub to doorstep.
                    The new Speed Delivery Door:
                    The sensor-controlled, automatic two-wing pivoting door can be installed upon request in place of the sliding door on the side 
                    of the load area. Initial customer testings with large national and international courier-, express- and parcel service providers have 
                    demonstrated added value in the fields of ergonomics and time savings as a result of a reduction in the number of work steps involved, as well 
                    as increased safety for driver e.g. by a better view to outside and theft protection of load.
