                The wellness market is booming. Consumers intend to keep spending more on products that improve their health, 
                fitness, nutrition, appearance, sleep, and mindfulness. In this edition, The Next Normal explores the fast-changing, 
                fast-growing wellness industry.

          <b>2040: Our vision for the future of health </b><br><br>
          By 2040, health care as we know it today will no longer exist. There will be a fundamental shift from “health care” to “health.” And while disease will never be completely eliminated, through science, data, and technology, we will be able to identify it earlier, intervene proactively, and better understand its progression to help consumers more effectively and actively sustain their well-being. The future will be focused on wellness and managed by companies that assume new roles to drive value in the transformed health ecosystem. <br><br>

          Driven by greater data connectivity; interoperable and open, secure platforms; and increasing consumer engagement, archetypes are likely to emerge and will replace and redefine today’s traditional life sciences and health care roles to power the future of health. The 10 archetypes will fall into three distinct, but interconnected, categories:<br><br>

          <b>Data and platforms:</b> These archetypes will be the foundational infrastructure that form the backbone of tomorrow’s health ecosystem. They will generate the insights for decision making. Everything else will build off of the data and platforms that underpin consumer-driven health.<br>
          <b>Well-being and care delivery:</b>These archetypes will be the most health-focused of the three groupings, made up of care facilities and health communities—both virtual and physical, and will provide consumer-centric delivery of products, care, wellness and well-being.<br>
          <b>Care enablement:</b> These archetypes will be connectors, financers, and regulators that help make the industry’s “engine” run.<br><br>
          All three components need to be fully functioning and integrated for the future of health to come to life.<br><br>

          Whether it’s just one or several of these archetypes, life sciences and health care organizations need to make choices now to decide which role(s) they want to play in the future.<br> Critical to this decision is understanding how multiple archetypes could fit together into a cohesive strategy and new business models required for success in the future.<br><br>

                    of COVID-19 , We anticipate an acceleration in e-commerce—specifically, in the over-the-counter space. 
                    Right now, OTC e-commerce sales are only 2 to 3 percent of sales in the US,
                    so there is lots of room for growth. As with many other retail businesses, 
                    we’ve seen a significant increase in OTC online purchases as a result of COVID-19. And I think that will stick. 
                    I don’t think it will go back to pre-COVID-19 levels. Consumers are getting used to OTC being part of their overall shopping basket.

                  The COVID pandemic has revealed the fragility of healthcare systems and how clinics and hospitals were completely unprepared for the crisis. 

                  However, this is just part of a bigger problem. In many ways healthcare facilities are still stuck in the 20th century and are long overdue for a top-to-bottom overhaul with digital health leading the way. 

                  So in my latest video episode, I’d like to talk about new ways of thinking about healthcare, and how hospitals should be redesigned for the 21st century.
